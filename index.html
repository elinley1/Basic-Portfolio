                <p>I have lived in Atlanta for the past 27 years after moving with my family from Denver. Although most of my relatives live in Denver, Atlanta is my home and I chose to attend college in state at Georgia State University. There I received a Bachelor's Degree in International Economics and Modern Languages followed by a Master's in Public Administration. While working towards my Master's, I worked as a Senate Aide for Sen. Nan Orrock (D-36) and eventually began working as her Executive Assistant at Women's Action for New Directions (WAND), a nonprofit advocating for female state legislators to seek higher office.</p>
